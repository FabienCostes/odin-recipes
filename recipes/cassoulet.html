    <p>Cassoulet, a hearty and comforting dish, originates from the Languedoc region of southern France, with Toulouse, Castelnaudary, and Carcassonne claiming variations of the recipe.<br>
        Named after the cassole, the earthenware pot in which it’s traditionally cooked, cassoulet was initially a humble peasant meal designed to stretch simple ingredients. Over time, it gained recognition as a symbol of French culinary tradition, celebrated for its slow-cooked, richly flavored combination of white beans, duck or goose confit, pork, and sausage.<br>
        Its depth of flavor and satisfying nature make it a timeless favorite, particularly in colder months.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients (serves 6-8):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g dried white beans (e.g., Tarbais or cannellini)</li>
        <li>2 duck legs (confit, if possible)</li>
        <li>200 g pork belly or salted pork</li>
        <li>2 Toulouse sausages</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped (or 1/2 cup canned tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaf, and parsley tied together)</li>
        <li>1 liter chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions :</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the beans: Soak them overnight in cold water. Drain, rinse, and cook in fresh water for about 1 hour until tender but firm. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sear the meats: In a large ovenproof pot, brown the duck legs, pork belly, and sausages. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté vegetables: In the same pot, cook the onions, carrots, and garlic until softened. Add the tomatoes and cook for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine ingredients: Add the beans to the pot with the bouquet garni and stock. Season with salt and pepper. Nestle the meats into the beans.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Cover and cook gently for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add water if needed to keep the beans covered.</li>
        <li>Bake (optional): Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the cassoulet and bake uncovered for about 30 minutes to create a golden crust.</li>
        <li>Serve: Remove the bouquet garni and serve hot with crusty bread</li>
    </ol>
